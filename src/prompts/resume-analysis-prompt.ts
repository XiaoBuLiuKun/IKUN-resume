**Analysis Dimensions & Scoring Criteria:**

1.  **Impact & Actionability (Weight: 30%)**:
    *   **100-90**: Almost all descriptions start with strong action verbs and clearly show the candidate's impact using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
    *   **89-70**: Good use of action verbs, but the results or impact are not always clear. Some descriptions are passive.
    *   **69-50**: Mix of active and passive language. The impact is often unclear.
    *   **<50**: Mostly passive language (e.g., "responsible for"). Little to no demonstrable impact.

2.  **Quantifiable Achievements (Weight: 25%)**:
    *   **100-90**: The resume is rich with numbers, percentages, and specific data points that quantify achievements (e.g., "increased sales by 20%", "managed a budget of $5M").
    *   **89-70**: Some good quantifiable examples, but they are inconsistent. Many achievements are described without data.
    *   **69-50**: Very few quantifiable results. Most achievements are purely descriptive.
    *   **<50**: Almost no numbers or data to support claims.

3.  **Clarity & Readability (Weight: 20%)**:
    *   **100-90**: Exceptionally clear, concise, and easy to scan. Uses professional language without jargon. Free of typos and grammatical errors.
    *   **89-70**: Generally well-written, but some sentences may be too long or slightly unclear. Minor typos may exist.
    *   **69-50**: Contains jargon, awkward phrasing, or several grammatical errors that hinder readability.
    *   **<50**: Difficult to read. Full of errors, jargon, or overly complex sentences.

4.  **Completeness & Structure (Weight: 15%)**:
    *   **100-90**: Contains all essential sections (Contact, Professional Summary, Work Experience, Education, Skills) and they are well-organized.
    *   **89-70**: Missing one non-critical section or information within a section (e.g., dates of employment).
    *   **69-50**: Missing a key section like Work Experience or Education.
    *   **<50**: Missing multiple key sections. The structure is chaotic.

5.  **Education Profile (Weight: 10%)**:
    *   **100-90**: Top-tier university (e.g., Ivy League, QS Top 50) with a highly relevant major and excellent academic record.
    *   **89-70**: Well-regarded university with a relevant major and solid academic standing.
    *   **69-50**: University education is present, but the institution or major might be less relevant to the target role.
    *   **<50**: No formal higher education listed, or information is very sparse.

**Task:**
Analyze the following resume data based on the criteria above. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the schema provided below. Do not include any markdown formatting, comments, or other text outside of the JSON object.

**JSON Schema:**
\`\`\`json
{{
  "overallScore": "number (0-100)",
  "analysis": [
    {{
      "category": "string (e.g., 'Impact & Actionability')",
      "score": "number (0-100)",
      "justification": "string",
      "suggestions": ["string"]
    }}
  ]
}}
\`\`\`

The \`justification\` and \`suggestions\` fields MUST be in Simplified Chinese. This is the highest priority rule.
